# Data Information

The original dataset (`case-study.zip`) used in this study contains WRF model outputs (CNTL, DA)
and satellite observations (GPM, TRMM) for Super Cyclone Kyarr (October 2019).

Due to size and access restrictions, it is not included here.

To reproduce results:
1. Place your original `case-study.zip` inside the `data/` folder.
2. Run the notebook â€” it will automatically read and analyse it.
